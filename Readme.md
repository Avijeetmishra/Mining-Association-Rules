Homework 2: Mining Association Rules from Gene Expression Data

Discription: In this homework, we implemented the Apriori algorithm to find all frequent itemsets. And based on these frequency sets , we generated Association rules which satisfy the given queries.

To directly execute the code, go to "Homework2\Code\WindowsFormsApplication2\WindowsFormsApplication2\bin\Debug" and run "WindowsFormsApplication2.exe".

Instructions
* The file "WindowsFormsApplication2.sln" is present in the "Data Warehouse_OLAP operations' folder.
* Open the file in Microsoft Visual Studio.
* Build the solution by selecting 'Build->Build Solution'.
* To run the file click on start.
* Here dropdown lists are present which lets the user select the constraints for support and confidence. 
* Clicking on a Run algorithm, gives all the frequency itemsets for that support value.
* Clicking on a Rule Generation, takes you to a new window where the user select the constraints for support and confidence.
* All the result of the queries are displayed and double clicking on them displays the resulting rules
